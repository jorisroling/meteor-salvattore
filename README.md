Meteor implementation of [Salvattore](http://salvattore.com)

Use ```{{ > salvattore }}``` in your template where you'd like to have the salvattore grid.

And and items to that grid by calling ```salvattore.addItem(data,templateName)```.

This implementation uses Bootstrap 3 to actually define the grid. Please add a bootstrap package of your own choice.
